# Phishing Invoice Case

🌸 **Objective**: Investigate a suspicious domain used in a fake invoice phishing campaign.  
This case is part of my learning journey in threat intelligence and OSINT.

## 🔍 What I'm investigating:
- A phishing domain pretending to be an invoicing service
- Its infrastructure (IP, certs, WHOIS, etc.)
- Possible related domains or reused techniques

## 📦 Tools used:
- VirusTotal
- URLscan.io
- WHOIS lookup
- Shodan
- DNS tools

## 📄 Files in this case:
- `report.md` – main report
- `iocs.txt` – indicators of compromise
- `screenshots/` – visual proof
- `notes.md` – raw notes and steps
